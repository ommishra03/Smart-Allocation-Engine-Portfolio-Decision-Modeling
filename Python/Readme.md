# 🧠 Python — Modeling & Intelligence Layer

This folder contains the **advanced analytical and modeling logic** of the project.

Python is used **after** SQL, Excel, and Power BI to extend analysis beyond what spreadsheets and dashboards can reasonably handle.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Layer

- Perform portfolio-level risk analysis
- Validate and reproduce Excel and Power BI results
- Implement allocation logic and comparisons
- Prepare groundwork for optimization and automation

Python is used to **enhance insights**, not replace earlier layers.

---

## 🧠 Key Responsibilities

Typical analyses in this layer include:

- Volatility and drawdown computation  
- Risk-adjusted performance metrics  
- Portfolio comparison logic  
- Scenario and stress testing  
- Cross-validation against SQL and Excel outputs  

---

## 🔁 Position in the Pipeline

> *SQL → Excel → Power BI → Python*


Python operates on **clean, validated data only**.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Any discrepancy with Excel or Power BI must be investigated
- Code prioritizes correctness and interpretability
- This layer evolves the project from analysis → decision engine

---

> *Python begins where spreadsheets end.*
