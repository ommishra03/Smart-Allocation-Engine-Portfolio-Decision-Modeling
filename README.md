# 📊 Capital Protection First – Smart Allocation Engine

A practical data analysis project focused on **capital preservation and risk-aware asset allocation**.  
The goal of this project is to analyze how different asset allocations behave under varying market conditions and to identify portfolios that aim to **reduce downside risk while maintaining stable returns**.

This project follows a realistic industry-style workflow using **Excel, Power BI, and Python**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Traditional portfolio analysis often focuses only on returns.  
This project takes a different approach:

> **Protect capital first. Returns follow.**

The objective is to:
- Compare different asset allocations
- Measure risk using real financial metrics
- Identify portfolios that offer better downside protection
- Build a foundation for future portfolio optimization

---

## 🧩 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel)
- Raw financial data cleaned in Excel
- Handled missing values and inconsistencies
- Standardized column names and formats
- Created calculated fields where required (returns, changes, etc.)

Excel is used intentionally to reflect real-world analyst workflows where data rarely starts clean.

---

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Analysis & Visualization (Power BI)
- Portfolio-wise return comparison
- Volatility and risk visualization
- Drawdown and performance trends
- Easy-to-understand dashboards for non-technical users

Power BI dashboards are designed with **decision-makers in mind**, not just analysts.

---

### 3️⃣ Analytical Processing (Python)
- Risk metrics calculation (volatility, drawdown, risk-adjusted returns)
- Portfolio-level comparisons
- Logic-based allocation analysis
- Data validation against Excel and Power BI outputs

Python is used to ensure analytical correctness and reproducibility.
