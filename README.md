## Architecture — Industry Workflow

```
   SQL Data Layer
         ↓
Financial Validation (Excel)
         ↓
Python Modeling & ML Stacking
         ↓
Live Allocation Dashboard (Streamlit)
```

Each stage has a clear analytical responsibility.

---

### 🔹 1 — SQL: Canonical Data Layer

SQL creates a deterministic financial dataset.

**Responsibilities**

- Deduplication & normalization  
- Fiscal year alignment  
- Metric standardization  
- Feature preparation  

This ensures the modeling pipeline begins from validated financial signals.

---

### 🔹 2 — Excel: Analyst Intelligence Layer

Excel is used for human-driven financial reasoning.

- Earnings sanity checks  
- Profitability vs Growth evaluation  
- Stability interpretation  

This stage mirrors how real analysts validate quantitative outputs.

---

### 🔹 3 — Python: Quant Modeling Engine

Python converts structured financial data into predictive allocation logic.

#### 📊 Feature Engineering

- Temporal financial windows  
- Growth signal extraction  
- Stability scoring  

#### Machine Learning Stack

- Regression models → Forward Net Income Prediction  
- Classification models → Growth Direction Confidence  
- Stacked Ensemble Architecture  
- LSTM Momentum Embedding  

#### 📌 Allocation Logic

```
Expected Growth × Confidence → Allocation Weight
```

The final signal represents portfolio preference strength.
